# DataForge

DataForge is an end-to-end data analytics pipeline that I am undertaking as a personal learning project during December 2024 and January 2025. The goal of this project is to illustrate how actionable insights can be derived from raw, unprocessed data. By integrating various open-source tools, DataForge demonstrates the entire workflow—from data collection, transformation, and storage through to analysis and visualization—within a cohesive, production-ready environment. Please note that DataForge is currently under development, and all of the following information serves only as an initial overview, not yet fully implemented.

## Overview

DataForge illustrates a modern data ecosystem where raw input files from a data lake (S3/MinIO) are ingested and refined into structured datasets in a relational database (PostgreSQL). These datasets are further transformed and enriched, enabling advanced analytics, machine learning applications, and visual reporting.

Created as a personal exploration project, DataForge serves as a reference implementation for anyone interested in building robust, scalable, and maintainable data solutions. It not only covers data ingestion and transformations but also delves into CI/CD workflows, ML experiment tracking, and interactive visualizations.

**Project Duration:** December 2024

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers the entire journey from raw files to analyzed, visualized, and production-ready data.  
- **Layered Data Architecture:** Employs a clear staging methodology (bronze/silver/gold) and supports transformations via SQL, Python, and optional dbt models.  
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Trains predictive models using scikit-learn, evaluating outcomes and reintegrating predictions into the data store.  
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards:** Connects final datasets to a BI tool (e.g., Tableau) for interactive, insight-driven dashboards.  
- **CI/CD & Best Practices:** Utilizes GitHub Actions for automated testing, code quality checks, and seamless collaboration.

This architecture shows the entire ecosystem, from initial ingestion in the data lake through structured storage in PostgreSQL, advanced transformations, machine learning integration, and ultimately the business intelligence layer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Python 3.9+  
- Git  
- BI tool (e.g., Tableau) recommended but optional

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/DataForge.git
   cd DataForge
   ```

2. Start the Docker Environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Set Up the Python Environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Configure MinIO or AWS S3:
   Update the `.env` file with credentials and endpoints. Test connectivity and file uploads before running ETL scripts.

## Usage

- Load Data:  
  `python scripts/etl_load.py` to ingest CSV files from S3/MinIO and populate PostgreSQL.

- Transformations:  
  Use Python or SQL scripts. With dbt:
  ```bash
  dbt run
  ```

- Machine Learning:  
  `python scripts/ml_train.py` to train models on curated data.

- Visualization:  
  Connect Tableau to PostgreSQL for interactive dashboards.

## Technology Stack

- Data Storage & Management: PostgreSQL, S3/MinIO  
- Data Processing & Orchestration: Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, dbt (optional), Docker Compose  
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn (MLflow optional)  
- BI & Visualization: Tableau or similar tools
